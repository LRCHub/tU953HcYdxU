[00:58.11] Baby this night
[00:59.90] I'll remember
[01:01.63] You gave me all the light
[01:03.29] When I surrendered
[01:05.65] You let me know
[01:08.56] That I know nothing at all
[01:13.37] Summer has come
[01:15.43] Worry's over
[01:17.21] It took a long time
[01:19.07] But I got wiser
[01:21.22] I'll take u home
[01:24.10] Life feels so incredible
[01:29.33] We were children oh so long ago
[01:33.25] But we still got a long long way to go
[01:37.10] Come on over, let's go higher
[01:41.03] Takes forever just to learn who we are
[01:44.68] Don't u be scared
[01:46.55] We're together
[01:48.52] Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
[01:52.36] As long as we're here
[01:55.34] We're forever young (young)
[02:00.03] We can be born
[02:02.25] Again and again
[02:04.00] Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
[02:07.70] As long as we're here
[02:10.92] Be forever young (young)
[02:16.66] My love
[02:33.18] I'm just a boy who strives for eternity
[02:40.86] And we're just kids with infinite energy
[02:47.71] I know we gonna know the truth eventually
[02:55.32] We are more than we think we are, so have some
[02:59.65] dignity
[03:03.00] We were children oh so long ago
[03:06.75] But we still got a long long way to go
[03:10.70] Come on over, let's go higher
[03:14.64] Takes forever just to learn who we are
[03:18.23] Don't u be scared
[03:20.24] We're together
[03:22.12] Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
[03:26.04] As long as we're here
[03:28.99] We're forever young (young)
[03:33.85] We can be born
[03:35.82] Again and again
[03:37.59] Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
[03:41.44] As long as we're here
[03:44.56] Be forever young (young)
[03:50.65] Baby let me give you my heart
[03:53.81] Give you my all
[03:55.38] They're no longer mine
[03:57.36] You've come and saved me
[03:59.42] Countless times
[04:01.33] From you, I got nothing to hide
[04:06.11] Lonely in the pouring rain
[04:08.96] But it was your grace all over me
[04:13.48] Can I go back again
[04:15.87] Child again
[04:17.62] We could do it all over again
[04:20.98] Don't u be scared
[04:22.61] We're together
[04:24.59] Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
[04:28.49] As long as we're here
[04:31.38] We're forever young (young, young, young)
[04:36.49] We can be born
[04:38.22] Again and again
[04:39.91] Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
[04:43.88] As long as we're here
[04:47.02] Be forever young (young)
[04:52.48] My love
