Baby this night
I'll remember
You gave me all the light
When I surrendered
You let me know
That I know nothing at all
Summer has come
Worry's over
It took a long time
But I got wiser
I'll take u home
Life feels so incredible
We were children oh so long ago
But we still got a long long way to go
Come on over, let's go higher
Takes forever just to learn who we are
Don't u be scared
We're together
Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
As long as we're here
We're forever young (young)
We can be born
Again and again
Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
As long as we're here
Be forever young (young)
My love
I'm just a boy who strives for eternity
And we're just kids with infinite energy
I know we gonna know the truth eventually
We are more than we think we are, so have some
dignity
We were children oh so long ago
But we still got a long long way to go
Come on over, let's go higher
Takes forever just to learn who we are
Don't u be scared
We're together
Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
As long as we're here
We're forever young (young)
We can be born
Again and again
Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
As long as we're here
Be forever young (young)
Baby let me give you my heart
Give you my all
They're no longer mine
You've come and saved me
Countless times
From you, I got nothing to hide
Lonely in the pouring rain
But it was your grace all over me
Can I go back again
Child again
We could do it all over again
Don't u be scared
We're together
Thirty-nine, sixty or whatever
As long as we're here
We're forever young (young, young, young)
We can be born
Again and again
Cuz every single day's ur birthday babe
As long as we're here
Be forever young (young)
My love
